# leaflet-challenge
Module 15

## Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Data Source
The earthquake data is fetched from the USGS GeoJSON feed, which provides real-time earthquake data for the past week.

## Technologies Used
Leaflet.js: For creating the interactive map.

D3.js: For fetching and parsing the GeoJSON data.

HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the map and legend.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/earthquake-visualization.git
- Open the index.html file in your browser to view the map.

- Explore the earthquake data by interacting with the map and clicking on markers.
